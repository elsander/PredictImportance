\title{Simulate Lotka-Volterra population dynamics and get summary stats}
\usage{
OneRun(matname, popname)
}
\arguments{
\item{matname}{path to parameterized network to be simulated}

\item{popname}{path to vector of equilibrium abundances for the network}
}
\value{
a data frame containing Jaccard distance, perturbation importance,
mean abundance, standard deviation of abundance over the simulation, and
network degree for each species in the network.
}
\description{
Read in a matrix and population file, simulate discrete-time
population dynamics with perturbed growth rates, and calculate
species importance, variability, and degree. Note that this function
is used internally, and many parameters (simtime, perturbation size)
are hardcoded. Use discreteLV() for your own simulations or
Step2_Discrete_LV() to replicate simulations from Wootton et al.
